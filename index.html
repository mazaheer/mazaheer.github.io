  <p>I am a second-year graduate student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University working under <a href = "https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~am2365/">Amita Malik</a>. Prior to this I obtained my M.S. in Mathematics from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan in 2024. 
    I did my master's thesis under <a href = "http://sites.google.com/view/emanuelcarneiro/home">Emanuel Carneiro</a> and it was titled <em>On Pair Correlation Conjecture and Bounds for the Averages of Montgomery's F-function</em>. 
  I completed B.S. in Mathematics from National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2022.</p>

  <p>I am primarily interested in analytic number theory, particularly in the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the derivatives of the completed Riemann zeta function,
   moments of the Riemann zeta function, zero-free regions and zero-density estimates of L-functions, and distribution of primes.</p>

  <p><b>Fun problem 1.</b> Two circles A and B are externally tangent. The radius of circle A is one-third that of circle B. Circle A rolls without slipping around circle B. How many complete rotations does circle A make before returning to its starting position?</p>
  <p><b>Fun problem 2.</b> The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds their number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If even one prisoner does not find their number, all prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy — but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?
