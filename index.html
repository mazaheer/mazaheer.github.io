  <h1>Muhammad Atif Zaheer</h1>
  <p>I am a second-year graduate student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University working under <a href = "https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~am2365/">Amita Malik</a>. Prior to this I obtained my M.S. in Mathematics from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. 
    I did my master's thesis under <a href = "http://sites.google.com/view/emanuelcarneiro/home">Emanuel Carneiro</a> and it was titled <em>On Pair Correlation Conjecture and Bounds for the Averages of Montgomery's F-function</em>. 
  I completed B.S. in Mathematics from National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.</p>

  <p>I am primarily interested in analytic number theory, particularly in the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the derivatives of the completed Riemann zeta function,
   moments of the Riemann zeta function, zero-free regions and zero-density estimates of L-functions, and distribution of primes.</p>

  <h4>Conference and workshops I have attended:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><em>The Legacy of John Tate, and Beyond</em>, Harvard University, March 2025</li>
    <li><em>MAGNTS 2025</em>, Ohio State University, March 2025</li>
    <li><em>MPS Conference on Universal Statistics in Number Theory</em>, Simons Foundation, New York, September 2025</li>
  </ul>
