  <h1>Muhammad Atif Zaheer</h1>
  <p>I am a second-year graduate student working under <a href = "https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~am2365/">Amita Malik</a> in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University. Prior to this I obtained my M.S. in Mathematics from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. 
    I did my master's thesis under <a href = "http://sites.google.com/view/emanuelcarneiro/home">Emanuel Carneiro</a> and it was titled "On Pair Correlation Conjecture and Bounds for the Averages of Montgomery's F-function". 
  I obtained B.S. in Mathematics from National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.</p>

  <p>I am primarily interested in analytic number theory, particularly in the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the derivatives of the completed Riemann zeta function,
   moments of the Riemann zeta function, zero-free regions and zero-density estimates of L-functions, and distribution of primes.</p>


  <p>Here is my <a href = "Docs/CV (M. Atif).pdf">CV</a>.</p>
