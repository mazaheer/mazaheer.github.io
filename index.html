Hi, 

I am a first year graduate student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University. Prior to this I completed M.S. in mathematics from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) under the supervision of <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/emanuelcarneiro/home">Emanuel Carneiro</a> and <a href = "https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/3346">Shaheen Nazir</a>. I graduated with B.S. in mathematics from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in 2022.

    <br> <br>
I am primarily interested in analytic number theory (sieve theory, Riemann zeta function), algebraic number theory (Iwasawa theory, Galois representations) and arithmetic geometry (local systems, Tate conjecture).
