  <p><b>(10-05-25)</b> These days I am occupied with the task of trying to replace the RH assumption in Farmer, Gonek and Yee's paper with something slightly milder than RH like clustering of zeros of the deriviative 
  of the Riemann Xi-function near the critical line. At two points I thought I managed to replace the RH condition with clustering condition but it turned out that during the course of proving their main result they use an estimate for the logarithmic derivaitve of the Riemann zeta function near the critical line (the boundedness of which 
    has RH assumption in disguise) and use its estimate which is some subpower (depending on the real part of s) of log of t. I discussed this problem with Bob Vaughan as well.</p>

  <p>I am thinking of trying to gain expertise in analysis which would definitely come in handy while trying to tackle problems in ANT. </p>

  <p>This semester I am also doing a project on Hasse-Minkowski principle for the algebraic number theory class which is being taught by Shabnam Akhtari. I only attended a couple of classes
   and she must be really mad at me for missing classes.</p>

  <p>I am also taking a special topics course <em>Primes in Short Intervals</em> with Bob Vaughan where we are trying to understand Guth and Maynard's recent result on zero-density estimate for
   for the Riemann zeta function.</p>
