Welcome,

I am a first year graduate student in mathematics at Pennsylvania State University. Prior to this, I completed M.S. in mathematics (2024) at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) under the supervision of [Emanuel Carneiro](https://sites.google.com/view/emanuelcarneiro/home) and Shaheen Nazir. I graduated with B.S. in mathematics from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in 2022.

Here is my [CV](docs/assets/My_CV-2.pdf).
