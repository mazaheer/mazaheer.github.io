  <p>(August 18, 2025) Solved problems 1.1.1-1.1.14 except 1.1.10 for which I believe that one implication does not hold in general.</p>
  <p>(August 19, 2025) Solved problems 1.2.1-1.2.8.</p>
  <p>(August 24, 2025) Solved problems 1.2.9, 1.2.10, 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. For problem 1.2.9 I had to look up the solution becuase it was getting very tedious. The trick was to use the Ramanujan's identity.</p>
  <p>(August 25, 2025) Solved problems 1.5.2-1.5.4 regarding the Jordan's totient function (generalization of Euler's totient function).</p>
